# Seagrass-Detection
Marine Science project <br />
Dataset: Drone footage of various North-shore beaches (SnellsBeach, Sandspit, Brickbay) <br />
Training and evaluating Machine Learning models (SVD, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost) and Deep Learning models (MLP and U-Net) for Seagrass Detection<br />

The below shows two samples of the dataset and their annotated seagrass regions. <br />

The main goal was to train a model to detect seagrass regions, resulting in the number of seagrass pixels in each frame. The number of seagrass pixels in the computed orthophotos converted to meters based on camera calibration parameters to estimate the area of the detected regions in each beach in the dataset. This repository only provides the trained models, with some sample codes for training.
